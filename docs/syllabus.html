<h3>Course Title</h3>
<p>MTH 202A: Calculus II</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="description" class="section level3">
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Students in this course will deepen their understanding of the
foundational topics in calculus, including techniques of integration,
applications of integration, and infinite sequences and series,
including Taylor series. Ongoing emphasis on problem solving strategies
and the development of mathematical communication.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="core-statement" class="section level3">
<h3>Core Statement</h3>
<p>The University of Portland offers a liberal arts Core Curriculum with
a vision of students acquiring knowledge, skills, and values that will
prepare you to respond to the needs of the world and its human family,
while having a foundation of multiple lenses to address enduring
questions of human concern. The University Core Curriculum strives to
achieve this vision by cultivating six habits of heart and mind in all
graduates regardless of major. As a priority for this Core class, our
focus is the “scientific and quantitative literacy and problem solving”
habit.</p>
<p>As part of developing that habit this course will prioritize students
learning to employ mathematical and statistical skills to explore and
make sense of data. Toward this end, as one specific Core learning
outcome for this class, the expectation is that students who complete
this course will be able to use the tools of differential calculus to
solve complex problems and effectively communicate solutions in written
form.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="you-belong-here" class="section level3">
<h3>You Belong Here</h3>
<p>In our classroom, diversity and individual differences are respected,
appreciated, and recognized as a source of strength. I support the use
of mathematics as an analytic tool to challenge power, privilege, and
oppression. It is our collective responsibility to create a welcoming
space where ideas can be challenged while individuals are respected. I
ask you to support one another as you develop as mathematicians and
analytic thinkers.</p>

<div id="getting-help" class="section level3">
<h3>Getting Help</h3>
<p>Don’t hesitate to ask for assistance! I have help hours specifically
in place because I want you to succeed, and the best place to connect
with questions is one-on-one. If you can’t make it to my posted help
hours, let me know and we can find another time. Other help options
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post your question to the class Teams Question-Answering
channel</li>
<li>Get together with classmates to study together</li>
<li>Drop by the Math Resource Center, which offers both drop-in and
appointment-based tutoring.</li>
<li>Google it. If you find a resource helpful, let me know.</li>
</ul>
<p>I understand that life happens, and illness, depression, family,
relationships can disrupt our lives. When something arises, REACH OUT! I
want to be able to support you in this course, and can only do so if you
let me know.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="collaboration-policy" class="section level3">
<h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>
<p>I expect you to participate in the class through lectures,
discussion, labs, and other engagements. I also expect you to make use
of opportunities to get help outside of class (help hours, Teams, email,
tutoring) if you need help. Concise and specific messages are the most
helpful so I know how I can best help you.</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to participate in discussions with their
peers (or each other) regarding homework and other assignments. However,
each student must take responsibility and ownership of their work and
submit their work individually.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="help-hours-guidelines" class="section level3">
<h3>Help Hours Guidelines</h3>
<p>It is strongly recommended that you attend the walk-in help hours or
set up a one-to-one meeting with the me if you feel like you are falling
behind during our in-person class activities, or if you just need to
clarify concepts discussed in class. In order to be more productive
during a one-to-one meeting (or the walk-in help hours), these are three
recommendations before you come in:</p>
<ul>
<li>List all gaps in knowledge you have (missed concepts) or list all
concepts that were unclear to you during class. We will address them one
by one.</li>
<li>Prepare questions you want answered and be ready to show relevant
materials.</li>
<li>Regarding assignments, prepare to show (a) what are the steps you
have tried and (b) what are the errors you encountered and the
strategies you have tried.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these are recommendations so that you can get the most out
of the help hours allocated for you. If you just want to come in and
chat about something else, feel free to do so. If the dedicated time for
one-to-one meeting does not work for you, send me a message to set up an
appointment.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="the-learning-commons" class="section level3">
<h3>The Learning Commons</h3>
<p>Students can get academic assistance through Learning Commons
tutoring services and workshops. The Co-Pilot peer tutoring program
provides students with opportunities to work with other students to get
help in writing, math, group projects, and other courses. Students can
schedule an appointment to meet with a Co-Pilot (tutor) or they can also
meet with a Co-Pilot during drop-in hours. Check the <a
href="https://www.up.edu/learningcommons/index.html">Learning
Commons</a> website for more information. Find a tutor at the Learning
Commons to get support on your academic journey.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="math-resource-center" class="section level3">
<h3>Math Resource Center</h3>
<p>Appointment-based tutoring starts week 1. Drop-in tutoring is
Mon-Thurs, 3:00 PM - 6:30 PM in BC 163 and starts week 2. Visit the <a
href="https://www.up.edu/learningcommons/math-resource-center/index.html"
target="_blank">Math Resource Center</a> website with more info.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="accessibility-statement" class="section level3">
<h3>Accessibility Statement</h3>
<p>The University of Portland endeavors to make its courses and services
fully accessible to all students. Students are encouraged to discuss
with their instructors what might be most helpful in enabling them to
meet the learning goals of the course. Students who experience a
disability are also encouraged to use the services of the Office for
Accessible Education Services (AES), located in the Shepard Academic
Resource Center (503-943-8985). If you have an AES Accommodation Plan,
you should make an appointment to meet with your faculty member to
discuss how to implement your plan in this class. Requests for alternate
location for exams and/or extended exam time should, where possible, be
made two weeks in advance of an exam, and must be made at least one week
in advance of an exam. Also, if applicable, you should meet with your
faculty member to discuss emergency medical information or how best to
ensure your safe evacuation from the building in case of fire or other
emergency.</p>

<h2><strong>Class Materials and Resources</strong></h2>

<div id="class-website" class="section level3">
<h3>Class Website</h3>
<p>The syllabus, tentative topics schedule, lecture slides, assignments,
and all other class materials are posted on the <a
href="https://upmathematics.github.io/mth-202a-sp23/">course website</a>
- the website can be viewed in Teams.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="assignments" class="section level3">
<h3>Assignments</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Homework:</strong> For most sections, you will be
required to complete an online homework via WeBWork. Homework is due
Monday, Wednesday, or Friday due 24-72 hours after it was posted.
Homework is graded automatically. It is strongly suggested that you do
your homework regularly; it’s best done following class, when it is
fresh in your mind. Most questions allow unlimited attempts and there is
no penalty for incorrect answers. If you find yourself stuck on a
problem after many attempts, please reach out for additional
help!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proficiency Quizzes:</strong> Weekly proficiency quizzes
provide opportunities to demonstrate your understanding of the course
learning targets. Each quiz will include 2-3 learning targets as well as
the option to reassess past targets. Proficiency should be attained
twice for each <em>core</em> learning target. Most Quizzes are written
and submitted in-person. Quizzes are conducted in class. Some quizzes
can have specific notes open and some quizzes are closed notes.
Electronic devices with or without access to the internet is not
allowed. Quizzes must be submitted at the end of class.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Labs:</strong> Semi-weekly labs will be due on Wednesdays
at end-of-day. Lab problems should be either typed or written and
submitted as a pdf file in Teams Assignments. These labs are part of the
Core Assessment, and will have common grading across all MTH 202
sections. Labs will be graded on three components:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Validity:</em> Is the method correct? Is the final solution
correct?</li>
<li><em>Explanation:</em> Is the solution method well explained? Is the
reasonableness of the solution justified?</li>
<li><em>Representation:</em> Is the solution process clearly written? Is
the solution supported with appropriate graphs/diagrams/equations? Is
mathematical notation used clearly and correctly?</li>
</ul>
<p>Labs can be hand-written or typed, but must be uploaded as a single
pdf file. Late labs will be lowered one grade scale. If you had
handwritten your answers/solutions on a physical paper, make sure to
label it properly and please scan your document using a scanner app for
convenience. Suggestions: (1) “Tiny Scanner” for Android or (2) “Scanner
App” for iOS.</p>
<p>To submit lab revisions, students must complete the following for
each problem you missed:</p>
<ul>
<li>An explanation of the errors you made (A algebra? Graphs? Is there a
specific concept?)</li>
<li>Resolve the problem: be sure to include a clear explanation of your
solution process so that another student in the class will
understand</li>
<li>Identify or create three difficult problems from this unit. (You can
find/modify problems from in-class activities, webwork, the textbook,
etc.) Solve each of the problems correctly, clearly describing your
steps.</li>
<li>Create a single PDF that includes (1) the previous lab, (2) the lab
corrections, and (3) the additional practice problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Revised labs can earn up to a score one point higher than the
original score (thus a “Not yet proficient” lab can be revised into a
“Proficient” lab.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Final Exam:</strong> The final exam includes two
components: a written assessment of the big mathematical ideas of the
course. This assessment will be cumulative: it will focus on connections
between ideas, conceptual understanding of the material, and
applications rather than nitty-gritty computations. The second half of
the final exam time will allow for reassessment of past learning
objectives.</p></li>

<h2><strong>Class Assessment</strong></h2>
<p>This course is guided by the philosophy that learning mathematics
requires focused effort, reflection, and revision. Assessment of this
course is based on a proficiency system, in which students have multiple
attempts to demonstrate proficiency, with opportunities to reflect on
and improve previous understanding.</p>

<div id="attendance-and-participation" class="section level3">
<h3>Attendance and Participation</h3>
<p>You are expected to actively participate in this classroom community.
Participation includes coming to class on time, being prepared, being
willing to ask questions and share ideas, setting up study groups
outside of class, attending tutoring sessions, posting helpful resources
online, and contributing to the Teams discussion channels. Exit cards
will be assigned regularly at the conclusion of class as part of
participation assessment. Group and individual presentations of ideas is
a required component of participation. We will cover new course material
on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Most Thursday class times will be for
small group work on labs and for proficiency assessment.</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>
<p><img src="images/mth-202-assessment-standards.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Labs will be graded on completeness, validity of the mathematics, the
clarity of the explanations, and the quality of the use of
representations to illustrate the mathematics based on the rubric.
Please see table below.</p>
<p>Quizzes will be graded similarly as the labs.</p>

<h3>Final Grades</h3>
<p><img src="images/mth-202-final-grades.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Note that these percentages are guidelines more than hard and fast
rules. I will consider the entire body of your work when making these
determinations, and this will also be informed by your own
self-assessments. I will never impose standards higher than those
outlined in the table but reserve the right to round down the needed
minimum percentages (in a way that favors you).</p>
<p>Decisions about +/- cutoffs will be based on (a) your performance on
the final assessment and (b) your achievements as a whole.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="revisiting-your-work" class="section level3">
<h3>Revisiting Your Work</h3>
<p>Much of your work in this class can be revised. Everyone’s path to
understanding is different but we all benefit from reflecting on our
mistakes. Since much of the mathematical content will build on previous
ideas, however, reflecting in a timely way is important (hence a
one-week deadline).</p>
<p>In addition to the regular in-class quizzes, you may re-assess any of
the Learning Targets that we’ve covered through any either of the
following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>On quiz days there is additional time to retake additional Learning
Target quizzes.</li>
<li>You may schedule a retake on a particular Learning Target to be done
during Help Hours in my office. This retake can be arranged to be done
via conversation rather than written form.</li>
<li>The final exam will be used for additional Learning Target retakes.
University policy requires that students take the final exam at the time
determined by the registrar.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some restrictions on re-assessing using these methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reassessments must be completed within 4 weeks of the first
scheduled assessment.</li>
<li>A reassessment application must be submitted via email at least 24
hours in advance of the reassessment time.</li>
<li>Reassessment applications must include the name of the learning
target and a copy of written corrections from the previous quiz.</li>
<li>You may not do more than one re-assessment per learning target
outside of class per week.</li>
<li>No re-assessments will be given during finals week other than during
the final exam time.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Oral Exams:</em> At any time, students may be requested to
complete an oral exam to explain or clarify their written work on labs
or proficiency assessments. Such oral exams can impact a students’ grade
on the given assessment.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="late-assignments-and-incompletes" class="section level3">
<h3>Late Assignments and Incompletes</h3>
<p>You are expected to turn in all completed assignments on time.
Circumstances that may disallow you to turn in your work on time – such
as a medical reason – are understandable. Please let the instructor know
if you are unable to submit your work and have missed the deadline way
beyond its original posted date. Because every assignment is an
important aspect of your learning in this class, we will discuss when
you will turn in the assignment as well as decide upon an acceptable
consequence for your turning it in late. I am committed to successfully
helping you learn from this course.</p>

<li><p>Give your undivided attention to the class discussions.</p></li>
<li><p>If you don’t agree with what someone else has to say, you are
encouraged to express your point of view, but do so respectfully, and
support your claims with textual evidence.</p></li>
<li><p>Everyone has the right to be heard. Maintain confidentiality if a
person decides to share a personal experience.</p></li>
<li><p>No name calling and respect each person’s identity.</p></li>
<li><p>One person speaks at a time. Give chances for other people to
speak.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintain the highest standards of excellence for both you and
others.</p></li>
<li><p>Possess the humility to understand that you are not an expert in
everything and that everyone has room for improvement.</p></li>
<li><p>Realize that each person will start with a distinct set of
skills.</p></li>
<li><p>Take care of yourself. If you need to step out of the classroom
to have a moment to yourself - or go the bathroom - feel free to do
so.</p></li>

<h3>Non-Violence Statement</h3>
<p>The University of Portland is committed to fostering a community free
from all forms of violence in which all members feel safe and respected.
Violence of any kind, and in particular acts of power-based personal
violence, are inconsistent with our mission. Together, we take a stand
against violence. Join us in learning more about campus and community
resources, UP’s prevention strategy, and reporting options on the Green

<div id="academic-honor-principle" class="section level3">
<h3>Academic Honor Principle</h3>
<p>Academic integrity is openness and honesty in all scholarly
endeavors. The University of Portland is a scholarly community dedicated
to the discovery, investigation, and dissemination of truth, and to the
development of the whole person. Membership in this community is a
privilege, requiring each person to practice academic integrity at its
highest level, while expecting and promoting the same in others.
Breaches of academic integrity will not be tolerated and will be
addressed by the community with all due gravity.</p>
<p>In your written work, follow the conventions of an appropriate
citation using the APA, MLA, CSE, or SIAM styles. Please consult with
the instructor - or <a

<div id="inclusion-and-diversity" class="section level3">
<h3>Inclusion and Diversity</h3>
<p>The natural and mathematical sciences are often viewed as objective
disciplines. Science is a method for us to understand how the world
works. However, it is historically built from a small set of privileged
populations that often ignores the biases. I acknowledge that there may
be some parts in this course that have overt and covert biases. Science
is a human endeavor, and the pursuit of knowledge and skill must
incorporate a diverse set of experiences.</p>
<p>I value all students regardless of their background, country of
origin, race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability
status, etc. I am are committed to providing a climate of excellence and
inclusiveness within all aspects of this course. If you have any
concerns, issues, or challenges, you are encouraged to discuss with the
instructor (set up a meeting by email or a direct message in Teams) with
the assurance of full confidentiality except for academic integrity code
violations or sexual harassment (which I am obligated by law to
report).</p>

<div id="mental-health-statement" class="section level3">
<h3>Mental Health Statement</h3>
<p>As a college student, you may sometimes experience problems with your
mental health that interfere with academic experiences and negatively
impact daily life. If you or someone you know experiences mental health
challenges at UP, please contact the University of Portland Health and
Counseling Center in Orrico Hall (down the hill from Franz Hall and near
Mehling Hall) at 503-943-7134 or <a href="mailto:hcc@up.edu"
class="email">hcc@up.edu</a>. Their services are free and confidential,
and if necessary they can provide same day appointments. In addition,
phone counseling is available by calling 503-943-7134 and pressing 3.
The University of Portland Campus Safety Department (503-943-4444) also
has personnel trained to respond sensitively to mental health
emergencies at all hours. Remember that getting help is a smart and
courageous thing to do – for yourself, for those you care about, and for
those who care about you.</p>

<div id="covid-19-related-statements" class="section level3">
<h3>COVID-19 Related Statements</h3>
<p>Generally, students are expected to attend all class sessions
according to the instructor’s direction. Students who feel unwell or
have a temperature above 100 degrees should NOT attend class in person.
These students should inform their instructor as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Students who must be in isolation due to COVID-19 symptoms or a
positive test should also contact their instructor as soon as possible
to work out details for keeping up with the course material while in
isolation.</p>
<p>Should the instructor test positive for COVID-19, even without
symptoms, the course will be temporarily conducted remotely. Should the
instructor be unable to teach for an extended period of time, the
respective department or unit will find a substitute to continue the
course.</p>
<p>Following current guidance from our county and state health
authorities, face coverings are highly recommended in the classroom and
all indoor spaces. As we move through the semester, however, classroom
rules and procedures may change. All students and instructors must
follow any University-wide COVID-19 rules and procedures that might be
in put place at any given time during the semester for classrooms, labs,
and all common areas of academic buildings. Such rules and procedures
may include required face coverings, suggested distancing protocols and
directions, and limitations on eating and drinking in the classroom,
among other things. Failure to follow any of the COVID-19 classroom
rules in place at the time could result in a student’s removal from the
course and/or a report filed with the Office of Student Conduct.</p>

<div id="ethics-of-information" class="section level3">
<h3>Ethics of Information</h3>
<p>The University of Portland is a community dedicated to the
investigation and discovery of processes for thinking ethically and
encouraging the development of ethical reasoning in the formation of the
whole person. Using information ethically, as an element in open and
honest scholarly endeavors, involves moral reasoning to determine the
right way to access, create, distribute, and employ information
including: considerations of intellectual property rights, fair use,
information bias, censorship, and privacy. More information can be found
